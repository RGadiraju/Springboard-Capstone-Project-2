# Springboard-Capstone-Project-2

This project seeks to answer the question: Can we predict the points per game an NBA player will score in the following season using his statisitcs from the past season? Various NBA player statistics from previous seasons will be analyzed by multiple machine learning models to see how they affect & can be used to predict the average points per games that will be scored by a player the following season. 

The data used, steps taken, insights, & conclusions can be seen within the attached code, final report, & slides. Overall, it can be seen that previous season statistics explain a high % of the variation in the points per game average a player will have in the following season & the models created can predict that points per game average fairly accurately.
